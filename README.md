# Deepfake-Detectors---Phase-A
This study uses InstructBLIP to detect deepfakes better than older tools like SBI. Our VLM works well even with few or zero examples, using PEFT to train only the Q‑Former. The system calculates an accurate anomaly score with logit normalization instead of just text. AUC and clustering show it clearly separates real and fake images.
